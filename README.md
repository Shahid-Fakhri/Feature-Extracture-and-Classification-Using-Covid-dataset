# Identification of covid and non-covid patient from Chest Xray using feature vector extraction through Gabor filter and feature vector extraction through Resnet model using transfer learning 
Early and accurate diagnosis of diseases can often save lives. Diagnosis of diseases from x-rays samples is done manually by medical specialist. Diagnostics process is usually time consuming and expensive. Hence, automated analysis of diseases detection from x-rays images samples has critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment. The computer aided systems can improve the quality of diagnoses and give medical professionals a second opinion for critical cases. In this project, a machine learning based approach has been proposed to classify Chech Xray images automatically as to be Covid or non-covid.

## Dataset
* Kaggle.com
* Covid chest-xray image

* Non-Covid chest-xray image

## Objectives
* Feature vector extraction through Gabor filter
* Feature vector extraction through Resnet model using transfer learning
* Support Vvector machine model for classification

## Performance of SVM on combined features vectors
